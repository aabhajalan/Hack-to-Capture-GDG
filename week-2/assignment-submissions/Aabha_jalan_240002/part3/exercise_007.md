2) the name of the structure in the middle is holmem sol, so put that in google maps and found its coordinates.
3) used google lens to search up the poster, found that it is a tutankahum poster.
4) using the street view on google maps at different places, found the poster on oct 2019, but not in sept, 2018, so the picture is from 2019
5) now searched for the tutankahum poster, lisbon (after translating to portugese) and found a facebook post that contained the exact poster from the image, the link was: `www.tutankamon.pt`
