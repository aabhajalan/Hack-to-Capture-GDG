1) used google search on the image, and found the `san diego zoo` to be the most popular
2) searched for the zoo on google maps and found pictures that confimred its location, specifically the big boulder and the slanted rock structure.
3) searched up the temp of san diego zoo on 15th Jan, at 2pm and found it to be 15 deg celcius.
4) to get the exact cooridnates of the polar bear, saw a video that had the same landmarks as the photo as well as a white shed on top, which was visible on google maps, so the polar bear was probably near that area `32°44'04"N 117°09'16"W`
